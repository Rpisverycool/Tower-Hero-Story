    <h1> Facility Frenzy</h1>

    <h3>
        </html>Facility Frenzy was home to sentries and viruses, which show no mercy at all. There was a scientist, and the heroes were told on the way that the scientist was one of the 
        strongest heroes EVER. The scientist, however, did not have any mana to get to max level. He had to hide, or he would be destroyed by the sentry’s laser. But there was one problem 
        even if they saved the scientist. The problem was that behind all these sentries spawning everywhere was because of the boss. The Chaos Sentry. It was stronger than the other bosses 
        and was faster. So, the heroes went on to fight the Chaos Sentry and retrieve scientist. They found scientist tied to a crate, but he was being guarded by Malware and Giant Sentries. 
        Wizard was forced to use his ability earlier before he and the others got to the boss. Wizard killed the Malware and the Giant Sentries while Beebo and Fracture untied scientist from 
        wires. But that set the alarm and made more sentries and malware storm down the hall. However, by the time they reached the heroes, Lemonade Cat got tons of mana to finally upgrade 
        scientist to the max level. Now unstoppable, Scientist destroyed every enemy with his gigantic laser. With that many robots killed. The first boss came out. The Mega Sentry. Not so 
        strong but not so weak, The Mega sentry was destroyed fast. Then came the Ultra Sentry, strong and fast. He was a tough one but was took out quickly. Then, there he was he was, the 
        thing behind the scenes. The Chaos Sentry. The team only had one goal at that time. That was to defeat The Chaos Sentry. Scientist, Fracture, and Chef did a ton of heavy damage and 
        dropped the Chaos sentry to one-third of its health, but it kept on summoning giant red sentries making hard nearly impossible to even attack The Chaos Sentry. Wizard could barely 
        even do anything. However, he got so mad that he took 3,000 mana from Lemonade Cat and used his ability one more time! So now he could deal a ton of damage and finish the Chaos Sentry 
        off. They got this skin, but it was for someone they did not even meet yet. Weird… Anyways they continued with their journey to a gloomy forest called Frantic Forest.
