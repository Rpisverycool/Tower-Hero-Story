    <h1> Castle Town</h1>

    <h3>
        In Castle Town he met the greatest chef in the world, Chef. Chef says that once upon a time this town was raided by the great slime, Slime King. Slime King summons slimes and goblins.
         But one of the greatest things happened where a samurai came out of nowhere and wiped out the entire army, his name was Yasuke. But since that day no, one ever saw him again. 
         But then that evening became your worst nightmare. Even worse than the slime king. The Inferno Slime King. Chef and Wizard saw this huge monster. 
         But they had no choice but to destroy the Inferno Slime King and his army of slimes. Chef and Wizard single handedly destroyed everything and every slime. 
         Later, that day the Inferno Slime King turned into a little slime with a crown on himself. “What? Where am I?” The Slime king said. “You are awake and are in Castle Town” Wizard said.
          “WHAT?! How am I here? Wait a minute.” Slime king exclaimed. Then out of nowhere he opened a menu?! I do not know what that is. But still he turned into the inferno slime king but wasn’t bad,
           he asked wizard “This is one of my skins which I can equip, is it good?” Wizard was speechless he asked Slime King “HOW DID YOU DO THAT!” 
            “I will teach you on the way but for now let’s get going.” Slime King replied. With that the three heroes went on the journey to the next place, Corporate Chaos.
