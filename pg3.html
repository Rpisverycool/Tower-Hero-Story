    <h1> Volcano Valley</h1>

    <h3>
        </html>Volcano Valley, the home of the skeletons and among them lived the Molten Skeleton King. They met another hero! This time his name was Fracture. 
        He was a skeleton, and when leveled up he is an absolute beast! He turns into a skeleton king and throws crystals at enemies and kills them. 
        Fracture wanted a new skin and he asked Wizard, Slime King, Chef, and Lemonade Cat for help defeating the Molten Skeleton King. 
        They all agreed and set out to find and destroy the Molten Skeleton King. They found the Molten Skeleton King, but there was a problem. 
        He was guarded by Dark Skeletons and stronger Molten Skeletons. But as expected, there was no match to beat Wizard, Fracture, Slime King, and Chef. Then there he was.
         The Molten Skeleton King. Wizard and Chef swept almost half of his health. Then Fracture and Slime King swept the rest with Slime Kings slimes and fractures damage.
         With that they continued to the next place. Desolate Desert.
