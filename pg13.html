    <h3>
        Hello guys! My name is Rishik Peddi! I have been working on this book since 5th grade and finished it in 6th grade! Well, in 6th grade I didnâ€™t write at all. 
        With a ton of dedication, I managed to pull through and finish this book! Hopefully, if I get a chance, I will begin part 2! And I hope you great writers create an amazing book! 
        
        Peace! 
     
        NEXT BOOK! PART 2: The Rise of Saviors.
