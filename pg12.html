    <h3>
        </html>Cloudy Catastrophe was home to the wind elements and sky bandits. But they found a dog and the thing they were searching for, BALLOON GUY! “My name is balloon pal… Bruh” 
        Balloon pal said. “My name is discount dog!” The Dog said. “Nice to meet you too!” Spectre said, “Anyways, Discount dog and Balloon Pal… Do you want to join Team Heroes!” 
        “We would love too but can we first take out the bad guys here?” Balloon Pal said. “Who” a Beebo said “The Electrified Tiny Crew-” Discount dog said getting cut off by a Beebo “Cares” 
        the Beebo said while dabbing. “Well clearly you do if your name is Team Heroes.” Balloon Pal said calmly “Bruh… your supposed to be mad.” The Beebo said angrily. “But he is not…” 
        Discount Dog said. “Wow. I like these guys. They just got back at Beebo!” Spectre said. “HEY! YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE ON OUR SIDE!” All the Beebos yelled. “Just this one time.” Spectre 
        followed. “Fine…” The Beebos replied. “Anyways… since we will not need too many of you since you are overpowered, Balloon Pal your limit is three. Discount Dog yours is also three.”
        Spectre said. “Alrighty! That is cool!” Balloon Pal said. “Where are the other two of us? Discount Dog said concerned. “I will summon them. Give me a second” Spectre replied. 
        The rest of the Discount Dogs and Balloon Pals came out. “Aye wassup!” The Balloon Pal said. “Hola!” The other Balloon Pal said. “Finally… I have more of my kind!” The original 
        Balloon Pal said. “Thank you so much Spectre!” All the Discount Dogs said. “Aww, no problem!” Spectre replied. “Ugh now there are more of them.” A Beebo said. “BRO JUST SHUT UP!”
        Everyone screamed. “I do not shut up, I grow up. And when I look at you, I throw up.” A Beebo replied. “OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YOU JUST GOT ROASTED!” Another Beebo followed. 
        “Then if you throw up when you see me then why you are not throwing up?” A Balloon Pal said. “OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH KARMA!” A Voca said. “Ugh I hate you.” One of the 6 Beebos said. 
        “When?” A Wizard replied. “NOW OF COURSE I JUST MET HI-” A Beebo said getting cut off. “Did I ask” The Wizard finished. “OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH NOT AGAIN!” Spectre said. 
        “Ugh, can we just continue.” One of the 6 Beebos followed. “Ok I was ready from the first place.” The Discount Dog. “Bruh…” A Beebo said. 
        “LETS JUST GO ALREADY! JEEZ BEEBO CAN YOU JUST SHUT IT!” A Soda Pop said. “I Don’t shut up, I grow u- “One of the Beebo said getting cut off. 
        “If you don’t just shut up already your out of Team Heroes.” Spectre said. “And who is going to stop me?” A Beebo followed. “US!” All the other heroes but the Beebos said. 
        “Oh…” The Beebo said sadly. “Let just go.” Chef said. “Ok!” A Fracture said. Team Heroes went to their destination they needed to go up to the peak of the mountain where all 
        the ruckus was. “So, our goal Is to defeat the Electrified Tiny Crew or for short the ETC.” A Balloon Pal said. “But he has a lot of gusts and electric slimes guarding him.” 
        A Discount Dog said. “Then Let’s go kill them!” A Soda Pop said. “That is violent… But what is that over there?” Slime King said. Yup! There was someone who looked like a lady. 
        “She looks very sus.” A Beebo said. “Bruh my guys you could’ve said gloomy.” A Wizard said, “Another among us reference. “CAN I GO TALK TO HER ALREADY!” A Voca yelled. 
        “Fine I guess.” Chef replied. “Wish you luck!” Fracture said. “Hey! What is your name?” One of the Five Voca’s said after reaching her. “Why do I have tell you?” The Lady said. 
        “Because we all used to be one, AND we get to destroy evil.” “Evil you say huh?” “Yup! I did say that! Any problem?” “Alright I’m in!” “Oh um… What is your name…” 
        “Oh! My bad! Name is Maitake!” “Before we kick some booty you first need to meet Spectre” One of the Voca’s said. “Who is Spectre?” Maitake said, “Wait… could it be…” “
        C’mon we got to get going” Voca said. “Alright.” Maitake reached the rest of the heroes. She acted normal when meeting all the heroes but when she went to Spectre, 
        she was acting incredibly surprised. “Wait… Is that you Maitake?!” Spectre yelled. “SPECTRE!!!” Maitake replied, “Oh my… Its so nice to meet you again!”  
        “How do you guy know each other???” “Slime King and a Fracture asked. “When we both were in Frantic Forest, we were both lonely.” Spectre said. 
        “But then we met each other and were good friends!” Maitake followed. “Well how did you end up here?” A Dumpster Child said. “I ended up here because of the STUPID ETC!” 
        Maitake raged. “How???” A Lemonade Cat said. “Well, they looked for a new crew member, I ended up being the final crew member, but all they did was evil, by blowing up many maps. 
        Their most evil deed was ruining the beautiful barrens, now its surrounded by black goo that no one ever dared to touch!” Maitake said sadly. “Why is that?” Stella asked. 
        “Well, it was said that Yasuke, the samurai warrior, could not even defeat the minions forming from the goo, they also said that a boss is developing in the black goo, 
        the name is Demise. “We should go and defeat him!” One of the seven Soda Pops said. “No… He is way stronger than any other boss you could meet.” “Can we just go and defeat ETC” 
        A Balloon Pal said. “Okay, when did I stop you?” The Beebos said. “Wow...” a Stella said. With that the heroes found the top of the peaks where all the catastrophic events were 
        happening. “Wow this is beautiful!” A Dumpster Child said. “Im surprised its so deserted.” A scientist said. “Kinda su-” A Beebo said. “Just don’t say anything.” The wizards said. 
        “Su-” The Beebo said again. “SHUT UP” A Wizard said. “oh. I forgot. You need a limit.” Spectre said. “Alright. How many more?” Maitake said. “Four, I think three more at a limit of 
        4 would be good.” Spectre replied. He summoned the other three Maitakes. “Yay! I get friends!” A Maitake said, “thanks Spectre :D” “No problem!” Spectre said. “Oh wait… I forgot, 
        but we need to max you guys!” A Lemonade Cat said. “What do you mean by max?”A Maitake said.“Means push yourself using mana and go to your max limits.” A fracture said, 
        “It was pretty fun.” “Oh my. I like the sound of that!” The maitakes said. “Wow you look ummm….. Gloomy!” A Beebo said. “That’s more like it.” A wizard replied. 
        “What do you even do?” A Soda Pop said. “I spray people with my poison dust and make them poisoned.” A maitake said. “Wow… So you’re like them except a different effect other 
        than biohazard, radioactivity and burning.” A Scientist said pointing at the dumpster children. “I mean… I guess?” A maitake said. “ALRIGHT GUYS! THE ETC IS HERE!” 
        The Discount Dogs said. And BOOM there they were. The Electrified Tiny Crew (for short, ETC). “WHY IS THEIR SHIP SO HUGE!”  A Voca said. “ AIM FOR THE BALLOON!” 
        A scientist followed. “ BUT ITS ELECTRIC! IT’S MUCH MOR STRONGER THAN USUAL!” A balloon pal informed. “ SPECTRE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!” A Soda Pop said. “Yessir!” 
        Spectre followed. BOOM! A sudden strike into the guitar from spectre made all the heroes attack faster. “NO NOT THE BOOST!!!” One of the pirates said. “We’re going down crew! 
        ABANDON SHIP!” The captain said. *CRASH* the ship crashed into the mountain with the crew not to be seen. “We did it…” a Balloon Pal finished. “Yay new skins on top of that!”A Stella.  
        said, “Bullseye!” “TO EASY!” A Beebo said arrogantly. “Bro, you probably did 3x less damage than scientist.”A Fracture said. “I mean, never mind your right for once.” Another Beebo 
        replied. “OMG NO WAY, BEEBO AGREED?! :OOOOO.” Slime King said. “For once.” A Dumpster Child said. “Guys, I think we are all done.” A Chef said. “What do you mean?” A wizard said. 
        “For now, we beat the hardest boss and found the best heroes!” Another chef stepped in. “TIME TO TAKE A BREAK!” A Soda Pop said. “YAY!” All the heroes shouted in unison. 
        Little did they know, from here, all the bosses, would only get harder >:) . Take some rest heroes, you’ll need it for later in your journey.
