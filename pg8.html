        Let’s just say that the ice enemies didn’t really have an enjoyable time with the heroes. However, the heroes saw a little girl with a firework in a crate. She was like, 
        starving and cold. When the heroes approached her, she was really scared and backed up into the corner of the crate. She said, “Go away! The Mystical frostbite has done enough to me! 
        Just leave me alone! “Don’t worry and don’t be scared we will help you reach your max form using the power of Lemonade Cat! If you don’t come, I am afraid something will happen to you. 
        But if you do come, then you help all of us and watch us defeat all the evil bosses. Scientist (The strongest out of all the heroes) said. “Really?” The girl replied. “I mean there is 
        nothing to lose for you, so I guess it’s worth a try!” Spectre said. “I guess your right! All right, max me!” The girl said. “Yes madam! And with the girl maxed she introduced herself.
         “My name is Voca!” “Nice to meet you Voca!” All the heroes replied. When she was maxed, the heroes could clearly see that she was one of the strongest in the group now. But that didn’t 
         matter right now because on the way was Mystical Frostbite. The limit for Voca was five meaning 5 Voca’s would destroy anything. But now came the Mystical Frostbite. 
         The big bad boss of all the icy enemies. I don’t know if it was easy because the stupid Mystical Frostbite kept summoning stupid little weak icy golems that are like one hundred 
         times weaker than him. Really? Anyways, he was destroyed quick especially because he was a lot weaker than other bosses. Anyways the Heroes moved on to their next map. Canyon Calamity.
