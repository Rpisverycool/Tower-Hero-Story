    <h1> Corporate Chaos</h1>

    <h3>
Corporate Chaos was home to the lemon factory where business was only about lemons. They met a cat; his name was Lemonade Cat.
 He said that there was a Demolitionist and threatened to destroy the city if the businesses did not give mana (their money). 
 Wizard, Chef, Slime King, and Lemonade Cat decided to take on the Demolitionist to get a skin for Lemonade Cat. But instead, they saw his boss, the Advanced Demolitionist. 
 Wizard, Chef, and Slime King could not take him on. However, Lemonade Cat farmed mana to upgrade Wizard, Chef, and Slime King and after a tough battle they destroyed the Advanced Demolitionist. They just got a new member to the team and with their high hopes they went to recruit their next hero In Volcano Valley.
