        Knoddys Resort was home to some computer game-based enemies that come from a resort. There was a hero who saved this place from the Sun and Knoddy 
        and surprise he was the samurai who killed Slime King and the weakest ancient spirit. SIKE! It was a man named Beebo. I know, it is kind of lame. 
        But it is still a name so please do not make fun of it! The heroes went inside the computer. They saw the man, Beebo, right in front of them and he 
        was holding an ice cream. Do not ask me why he was holding it. But he went up to Wizard and asked him. “Can you help me destroy the sun.” 
        “WHAT?! But then there would be no sunrise and sunset. ☹” Wizard replied. “Bruh, you do realize that the sun I’m talking about is the impostor ඞ.”
         “Bruh, why do you have to make an among us reference….” Wizard said. “Who?” Beebo said. “Among us reference-” Wizard said getting cut off by Beebo. 
         “Cares” *dabs*” Beebo said. “Bruh.” Wizard replied. “OH GOD THE SUN IS COMING WITH KNODDY HELP!” Beebo said “Sure whatever.” Wizard said. 
         Wizard just took his wand, used his ability, and swept Knoddy and the Sun. Because they were WEAK. Anyways, Beebo is now on team heroes, and they
          set on their journey to a facility that was known for frenzies called Facility Frenzy.
