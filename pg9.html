    <h3>
        </html>Canyon Calamity was the home of the snake bandits and goblin miners as well as a whole lot more different type of enemies. 
        Very weird… But they found a boy with a boomerang. “OW! That hurt!” the Voca’s said. “OW! Stop that would you!” Slime King followed. “>:( STOP IT!” 
        The Dumpster Children replied. “Okay I will” The mysterious and annoying boy said. “My name is Keith. Take me on a journey! *Falls off the cliff*.” “What the!” 
        The Wizards said. “Don’t worry we got him” *throws crystal under him and saved him*. Ladies and gentlemen. We got him.” The Fractures said. “Oh, thanks 😊” Keith said. 
        “Ima just make you to your max from, so you don’t annoy me.” One of the Lemonade Cat replied. “Ok.” Keith followed. “There is a big giant snack. He looks very scrary.” Keith said.
        “*snake* and *scary*. Your hero limit is now eight” Spectre followed. “My bad, anyways, that giant snacks name is Coubler.” “ITS SNAKE FOR GODS SAKE!” Spectre screamed. 
        “Didn’t he just say that? One Keith replied.” “Wizard.” Spectre said “What?” Wizard replied, “Can we just throw them off the cliff?” Spectre replied. 
        “Uh I think we have bigger problems than him…” And there he was the ginormous Advanced Coubler. "Holy cow” Spectre said “RUN!!!!!” “Watch me.” all the Keith’s replied.
        And somehow the stupid cowboys were able to just throw his boomerang right under the Coublers body. “*inhales* OW….
        *inhales* AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. MY BODY! OWWWWWWWWWWWW!” Coubler screamed in pain. “easy” replied one of the Keith said.
        “Oh well I guess your strong cause you just killed a giant SNAKE. Spectre said. “Yay!” All the Keith’s yelled. And with that good impression on Keith, he was added to team heroes.
        But that is not the end of the journey because next up is Radiant Reef.
