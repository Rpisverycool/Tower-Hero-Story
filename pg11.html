        </html>“WOAH THIS CONCERT IS HUGE!” said a Beebo. “It sure is huge. But we should find another hero to recruit.” A Chef said. “Why are you so desperate???” A Fracture said. 
        “I don’t know. But I think this hero will be strong.” Another Chef said. “Let’s go search outside.” “My oh my. We should get to the exit on the other side which is like 20 mins 
        of walking away.” A Lemonade Cat said. “Bruh, you walked for 2 hours you can do this.” A Keith replied. “Just get on my slime king summon (his ability).” Said Slime King. 
        “Alright fine.” 
        
         
        20 MINUTES LATER OUTSIDE THE CONCERT…... 
        
         
        
        “Alright, we are outside the concert.” One of the Chef said. “What is that rat I see? It is holding some soda.” Two Dumpster Children said. “Let’s go talk to it!” 
        The Heroes went to the little rat and asked him to join the impressive, amazing, fantastic Team Heroes. “Hey little bud. Want to help us?” “I mean for what?” The mysterious 
        rat said. “For beating up the evil.” One of the Keith replied. “THAT SOUNDS SICK DUDE!” The mysterious rat replied.” I know. We can also make you to your max potential 
        if you want to join.” A Lemonade Cat said. “Then SURE! By the way, my name is Soda Pop.” The rat said. “Oh yes, I totally forgot. Your limit is seven!” Spectre said. 
        “WOW! So, there can be six more of me?!” Soda Pop said. “yessir” Spectre replied. “Wait… where are the other 6.” “I’ll spawn them just gimme a second.” Spectre replied. 
        “Alright fine.” “BOOM! There they are.” “THANK YOU SO MUCH!” A soda pop said. “I FINALLY HAVE FRIENDS!!!” “That’s what friends are for.” Spectre replied. “So, what is going on here.” 
        “Did you see the giant girl in the center of the concert?” “Yeah. Why?” “Well, she is the leader of the cats. Her plan is to take over the world.” “Oh my…” Stella said. 
        “Another person who wants to take over something.” “At this point I’m not surprised.” A Fracture said.” “Let’s go back in.” A Wizard said. “Sounds like a pan!” Keith said. 
        “PLAN!” Everyone yelled not including the Soda Pops. “Why did you all scream” A soda pop said. “THIS GUY CAN’T SPELL!” Spectre said. “Oh.” A soda pop replied, 
        “Let’s just go destroy that girl >:D.” “God your violent…” A scientist replied. The heroes went back inside the concert just to see everything was getting attacked by cats and servants (They work for the girl).  
        “My oh myyyyyyyyyy!” 3 Beebo’s sang. “Bruh, why that song. It sucks” A Voca replied. “No. Deal with it.” A Beebo said then dabbed. “OH YEAH DEAL WITH IT HUH! IF I KILL YOU, 
        YOU SHOULD DEAL WITH IT NOOB!” A Wizard replied angrily. “Ok, fine, just chill.”  The 3 Beebo’s said. “Stop fighting guys. First, we should deal with them…” A Voca said, 
        “apparently the blue one’s name is Charge. The pink one is Synth.” Voca said “How do you know?” A Beebo replied. “It is called reading a poster.” Voca replied, 
        “They are the first part of the concert.” “HEY WHO ARE YOU!” Synth and Charge yelled. “Uhhhhh, where is your boss.” A Keith said. “IDIOT! WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT” A scientist murmured. 
        “We won’t tell you without a fight.” Synth said. “Beating us is hard in every way >:D” Charge followed. “BRING IT ON!” A Soda Pop said. “Heh like you can do anything you little rat. 
        Oh wait, you are a rat! HAHAHAHAHA!” “OH YEAH THEN FIGHT US!” The Soda Pops said coordinated. We can just say that Synth and Charge underestimated the power of Soda pop 
        (with a little help of Spectre). “OW, STOP IT!” Synth said. “OK FINE ILL TELL YOU WHERE SHE IS!” Charge followed. “She?!?!?!?!” All the Beebos said, “Sus.” “Did he not listen to me?” 
        a Voca whispered to another scientist “AND WHY THE HECK WOULD HE SHOW THEM A PHOTO OF THE ROCK?!” a Voca said. “He is worse than Keith bro.” Spectre said. “Another among us reference. 
        Not surprised.” A Wizard said. “WHO EVEN IS THAT!” Synth said. “It’s a rock.” “What the. Does a rock look like that?” Charge said. “His nickname.” A Beebo said. “OHHHHHHH, anyways, my 
        boss is getting ready with her holo self. “What do you mean holo?” Spectre said. “She is linked to it. If it gets destroyed, then she faints.” “My oh myyyyyyyyyy - “A Beebo sang getting 
        cut off. “SHUT UP WOULD YOU!” A Voca said angrily. “The holo-drone is up there.” Synth said pointing at the statue of the holo-drone. “Get up there and you will have a chance to stop her
        evilness.” “Thanks for the info. We better get going.” Spectre said. “Your right. Let’s go.” All the scientists said. The Heroes climbed up just to see a ton of cat like enemies. 
        “You get the drone. I’ll manage them.” A Wizard said, “We will help.” All the other Wizards said.” The heroes ran inside. The Wizards easily managed off all the cat like enemies and ran
        Inside with the heroes only to see the girl finishing her preparations to take over the world. All his friends were locked up in cages behind the girl… “Oh hey, you little guys are a 
        little late for my plans. Oh yes, my name Is Mirai.” The girl said, “Ta-ta!” She followed going up an elevator. “Oh, we won’t let you leave, WIZARDS FIRE AT THE ELEVATOR!” BOOM! 
        The elevator was broken meaning Mirai could not escape. “Ohhhh, I see, so you want to go the hard way? Mirai said, then so It Is.” Mirai brought her holo-form down so it could 
        be 2 vs 13 instead of a 1 vs 13 which is unfair. But the problem is that Mirai was tough and would not go down so they wizards had to use their special ability. 
        They know they can each use it twice using the mana they had from ending the cats. But a Wizard spoke up and said, “All of you know we can all our abilities two times. 
        But did you ever try using it more?” “No, I never thought of that.” Another Wizard said. “I’ll try first!” A Wizard said. BOOM! A sudden explosion happened.
        After a couple seconds the explosion cleared out. “WIZARD! ARE YOU OKAY?!” A Voca yelled. “Yup, I’m fine. ONE MORE TIME!” he yelled. “Not again!!!” Another Wizard yelled. 
        KABOOM! This time the explosion was much bigger. But again, the explosion cleared out in just a few seconds. “BRUH WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!” A scientist said, 
        “YOU’RE ALREADY WEAK FROM THE FIRST TIME!” “Uh I’m fine.” The “wounded” Wizard said. “HOORAY! WE CAN USE OUR ABILITIES 4 TIMES IN TOTAL!” All Wizards yelled in triumph. 
        “Let’s all use It!” Another Wizard said. All the Wizards, now fully maxing out their ability do a ton of damage! “Uhhhhh, I can explain.” Both Mirai said. 
        “Hehe, too late >:D” A Wizard said. With the Mirai’s gone the Wizard’s had no trouble freeing all the heroes in the cages. “Thank you so much! I would have stayed there 
        the whole time.” King Slime said. “Same thing here!” Spectre followed. “I need to go to the bathroom.” All the Beebo said. “Bruh… It has been like 5 minutes since you went before, 
        we got trapped because of you.” A Fracture said. “Uhhhhh. Just in case.” “YOU SAID THAT BEFORE!” a Soda pop replied. “Just go fast.” Spectre followed. “YAY!” 
        The Beebo went to the bathroom. But when they came out one of them said that he found something. “HEY SPECTRE!” The Beebo said running out of the bathroom, “I FOUND A SKIN FOR YOU! 
        I ALSO FOUND THE SONGS FOR THE CONCERT!” “Wait… so you’re saying that I have a skin?” “YES!!!” LOOK AT THIS!” The Beebo said showing the skin. “YOOOOO! IT LOOKS SICK!” Spectre 
        said happily. “Spectre you have another skin as well! And Voca does to!” The Beebo said like he thought he did something important. “Oh wow! A holo-Voca skin!” “Wait a minute… What is
        that…” Beebo said. “What the.” A Keith said. They were saying things because a portal opened. It was a portal for skins. Beebo went in and came out with a massive surprise. 
        He had three skins from every map they faced. “LOOK WHAT I FOUND!” There was a skin for all heroes. Well, not all the heroes. “WOAH! HOW DID YOU EVEN FIND THIS???” 
        A Keith said in excitement. “Bruh did you not see the portal…” A Voca said. “What portal?” The Keith replied in question. “OH, MY, GOODNESS HOW ARE YOU THAT BLIND!” 
        Spectre replied angrily. “Hey. We got a skin!” a Keith said. “… Wow” The Dumpster child said, “Guys who even is Maitake, the guy with balloons, and the computer?” 
        "I don’t know.” Slime King said. “Maybe… If we go to other maps, then we can find them.” A Lemonade Cat said “Good idea. Let us go to the next map!” A Wizard replied. 
        “But where could they be?” A Soda pop followed. “Maybe on the peaks of the mountains…” A Chef said. “Wait… That would make sense! Balloons are in the sky!” A scientist said. 
        “Great thinking Chef!” A Fracture said, “LETS GO GET MORE HEROES!” “YEAH!!!” The Heroes yelled. The Heroes were super excited to find more heroes, so they went fast to the top 
        of the mountain with the help of scientists’ airplane. Next Stop. Cloudy Catastrophe.
