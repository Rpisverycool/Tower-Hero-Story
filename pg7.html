    <h1> Frantic Forest</h1>

    Frantic Forest was home to the very gloomy and scary ghosts. The heroes were told that if they went there, they must stop the Evil Tempre, and they must stop gloomy music 
    that is coming from the forest. They used scientist’s laser for a light source, and they found a ghost with headphones. He was so loud that scientist and wizard had to take 
    his speaker away from him. He asked them, “HEY! Why did you take my speaker? I love music!” “We like music too, but we don’t like it super loud.” Wizard replied. 
    “We will only give it back if you promise to help us beat the Evil Tempre.” Scientist said. “Wait… did you just say the Evil Tempre?” The ghost said. “Yes, I did, why?” Wizard said.
    “Oh… well I used to be one of the greatest and most powerful ghosts that could play the guitar because in my max form I can increase the damage that all good guys do. However, … 
    The Tempre brothers, the regular, the Shadow, and the Evil Tempre took all my mana that I hardly earned and used it to become immensely powerful, and luckily, earn a second form. 
    Now here I am. Scared of everything,” The ghost said, “anyways my name is Spectre!” “You know what Spectre? Since they have been that cruel why don’t you join us? 
    You can help us with giving us a boost on damage!” Fracture asked. “Fine, I will join. However, you must give me mana so I can reach my max form.” Spectre replied. 
    “Sure, we all can help you!” All the heroes said. “Ok! Let’s go get the Tempre brothers.” Spectre said. “Yeah!” The heroes replied. With Spectre now on the teams every single hero
    could pretty much double the damage of what they used to do. Lemonade Cat, who was super rich in mana, gave about 15000 mana to Spectre to finally max out Spectre to his final form. 
    They soon after 30 minutes reached where the Tempre brothers lived. In the Frantic Forest deep down in the caves. They saw the normal Tempre but obliterated it. However, 
    like Spectre said it had a second phase. But that wasn’t much of a problem because its second phase is weak. With the news leaked to the other 2 Tempre brother, the second brother, 
    The Shadow Tempre, decided to go out of his cave and oh boy he was surprised to see unfamiliar faces. The only problem Is because Spectre gives a double damage boost, 
    the cost of each hero goes up 30% mana. Meaning Lemonade Cat must do a lot and earn a lot of mana. However, he did get a lot of mana‍‍ on the way for reaching to Frantic Forest.
     So, with everyone ready, they obliterated the Shadow Tempre in more time than they killed needed to kill the Tempre. However, that enraged the Evil Tempre (the oldest brother) 
     to come out of his cave and fight the heroes. However, his second form was way stronger than the other brothers, it was a lot more than his whole health. But the heroes had to move on. 
    They said that it was finally time to destroy the Evil Tempre. They took a deep breath and then finally there he was. The Evil Tempre. Spectre did nothing so he screamed as hard as 
    he could and learned an ability to help other heroes by boosting their rate of dealing damage to enemies. But something even better Is that he extended the limit of every tower! 
    So, there could be five scientists, 7 Fractures, 6 Beebo’s, thirteen wizards, 12 Chefs, 5 Lemonade Cats, 8 Dumpster Children, 1 Slime King, and 1 Spectre. “YOOOOOOOO THERE ARE 5 MORE OF ME! 
    HEY GUYS!” said one Beebo “Hello dude!” said the other 5 Beebo’s. “Who did this?” A Beebo said. “I did.” Spectre said. So, with the overpowering army the Evil Tempre’s first phase was gone. 
    But now came the second phase. The second phase for the Evil Tempre was a lot stronger than the other 2 Tempre brother second phases. But because of what Spectre did and extended 
    the limit for how many of each tower could be placed and maxed, This Tempre was no easier than the other Tempre brothers. But with the Evil Tempre gone, the mission was a success! 
    With that the heroes continued to the next map. Glowing Glacier.
