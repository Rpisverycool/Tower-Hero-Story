    <h1> Desolate Desert</h1>

    <h3>
        </html>
        Desolate Desert was home to the golems where things were very desolate. The big bad boss was the Ancient Spirit. 
        They said that a long time ago the Ancient Spirit had the power to summon a giant golem bigger than the actual giant golem. 
        However, it was killed by the same samurai who swept King Slime in Castle Town. Lemonade Cat was a bit greedy and wanted another friend and a skin for himself.
         So, they went into the temple to find a dumpster? WITH A CHILD IN IT?!?!?!??!?!?! 
        He went up to Wizards legs and somehow breathed fire on to a skeleton rogue which was about three inches from killing Wizard. Ok then…  
        Dumpster Child was now added to the team, for saving Wizard from getting killed by a rogue. Once they got out, Dumpster Child asked his friends if they could kill the 
        Big Cursed Golem which is summoned by the second Ancient Spirit which they would kill before killing the strongest Ancient Spirit. So, they challenged the Ancient Spirit 
        to fight them. The Ancient Spirit was fast but weak, so they easily swept the floor with Ancient Spirit. But once they got to the Big Cursed Golem. Things got a bit tougher…
        He had so much health and could take in a ton of hits. But that did not stop fracture from sweeping the floor with Lemonade Cats mana. After a tough battle they managed to pull it off. 
        Now it was time to kill the strongest Ancient Spirit for Lemonade Cats new skin. The Ancient Spirit was a lot faster and a had a bit more health.
        But Fracture and Chef killed it by doing a lot of damage. But that was not the problem. The problem was the Dark Cursed Golem… 
        The Dark Cursed Golem was double the health of the Big Cursed Golem. And was double the size of it too. They did some damage but every now and then,
        the Dark Cursed Golem would stomp which would stun every hero. But it was Wizard who pursued through the stun and learned an ability! It increased his damage 
        and made him do a lot more damage and after 1 minute the battle was over, and the heroes had won again. Wizard was mad at Lemonade Cat for being greedy and nearly 
        making all the heroes die. But he was also happy at the same time because he learned a strong ability. So, he said to Lemonade Cat. “You almost made us die but you 
        helped me get an ability, so I guess you're spared. For now.” With that they went to their next destination. Knoddys Resort.
